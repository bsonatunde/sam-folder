        <p> The way a room is decorated and arranged has a huge impact on the perceived size of the space. Even rooms with ample square footage feel cluttered and closed in with improper furniture arrangement and too many accessories. With some simple rearrangement and possible relocation of unnecessary furniture pieces, you can breathe new life into a room that may have been missing one important element: open space

        <p id="the"> <em>Identify the Focal Point </em></p>
 <p> A rooms focal point plays an important role in creating an open and spacious furniture arrangement. This could be a fireplace, an entertainment center or a large window. Stand on the opposite side of the room facing the focal point and assess the view. If the focal point is obstructed by furniture and objects, this is a clear indication that the furniture needs to be rearranged. Also stand at the entry of the room. If the room appears cluttered with no clear indication of a natural walkway toward the exit point, the need for a better furniture arrangement is almost a certainty.</p>
